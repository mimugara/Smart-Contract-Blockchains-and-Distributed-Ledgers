# Smart Contract Blockchains and Distributed Ledgers

This repository contains the project from the course Blockchains and Distributed Ledgers of 
the Faculty of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh during the 2023-2024 fall edition.

This project aims to develop a smart contract based on the game of
Odds and evens and deploy it on Ethereumâ€™s testnet, Sepolia. The different
problems to be discussed are the implementation of a secure, gas-efficient
and fair smart contract.
